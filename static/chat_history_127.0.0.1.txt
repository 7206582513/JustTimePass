Q: how to find best positive line
A: I'll do my best to help you.

It appears that this text is related to linear regression and finding the best-fit line for a set of data points. The context is asking us to solve a problem where we need to find the equation of a line that minimizes the error with the given data points.

From what I can gather, the problem is asking us to:

1. Find the slope (m) of the line using the formula `m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`
2. Find the intercept (c) of the line using the formula `c = y1 - m * x1`
3. Use the formulas `y = mx + c` to find the equation of the line

However, the problem seems to be corrupted, and some parts are missing. Specifically, the text is missing the actual data points that we need to find the best-fit line for.

Can you please provide more context or clarify what kind of problem this is? Are there any given data points that we can work with to find the best-fit line?

Q: how to find best positive line
A: It seems like you're asking how to find the best-fit line for a set of linear data, given the information provided.

From what I can gather, the equation for the best-fit line seems to be:

y = 95 + (0.4)x

This equation appears to be a linear equation in the form of y = mx + b, where m represents the slope and b is the intercept.

To derive this equation, we can use the method of least squares, which involves minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals between the observed values and the predicted values using the linear equation.

In this case, it seems that the best-fit line passes through the origin (0,0), and the slope is 0.4.

To find the equation of the best-fit line, you can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the x-values.
2. Calculate the mean of the y-values.
3. Calculate the slope (m) using the formula: m = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2
4. Calculate the intercept (b) using the formula: b = ȳ - m*x̄
5. Write the equation of the best-fit line in the form: y = mx + b

Note that these steps assume that the data is linear and that there is no pattern in the residuals (i.e., the residuals are approximately normally distributed).
